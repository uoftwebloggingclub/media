Visual Style:
- Typically has a single image front and center, usually the product but sometimes something random to grab attention
- A small tagline or hook in large serif font (might have some subtext too), typically related to the image
- Smaller text segmented into 2-3 columns towards the lower half of the page
- Tycially black text and light background, though this can also be inverted

Text Style:
- Does not hold back on the technicals, assumes you are into computers (makes sense since these ads are for computer magazines and business catalogs)
- Drops as many stats and features as possible, and attempts to comstruct a weak narrative while reveling them
- Speaks as if they have the reader's unconditional trust; will make grand claims about how they sweep the competition
- Contact information in the final section of the text
