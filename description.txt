We are a club that fosters the creation and sharing of blogs and homebrew websites. If you are still learning the basics, you can develop your programming skills and creativity in a supportive envoriment. If you already have a website, you can have discussions with and draw inspiration from likeminded people (and get more eyes on your efforts). 

To get involved, check out our linked website and join the Discord (which should be linked on the home page). If you want to write an angry email on why we aren't using IRC you may do so at uoftwebloggingclub@tutamail.com.
